<h2>Trading Strategies</h2>
<p>There are a number of ways which you can use option data for a trading strategy.  There are are discussed on <a href="/blog/archive/trading-strategies">trading strategies</a> page.</p>
<ul>
<li>First there is max pain.  Stock options can be predictive since they hinge on the stock price being above or below the strike price on expiration.  This is the heart of max pain.</li>
<li>Open Interest Walls are a similar strategy, but offers a range of potential closes on expiration.</li>
<li>Option Implied Volatility provides one standard deviation values for the expected change in a stocks price, it is 68% likely to remain in that range until expiration.  Two standard deviations range is 95% likely.</li>
<li>The option greek delta provides a rough estimate of how likely a option is to be in or out of the money on expiration.  For example, an option with a 0.5 delta is 50% likely to be in the money.  A delta of 0.3 is 30% likely to be in the money.</li>

<h2>Tell me more about max pain</h2>
<p>
In a nutshell, max pain theory says that the option sellers (called writers) have stock on hand to fulfill the options if they are exercised.  These stock positions are maintained to minimize risk to the sellers, and this maintenance affects the stock price.  So, options can be the tail wagging the dog.
